This course is an introduction to modern quantum programming for students who want to familiarize with quantum computing technologies and learn about a new paradigm of computation.



### Course content

We will review:
- Quantum mechanics basics
- Circuit model of quantum computation
- Quantum programming languages
- Quantum communication protocols
- Quantum algorithms for long-term applications
- Quantum algorithms for mid-term applications
- Benchmarking QPUs


### Prerequisites

A physics and quantum mechanics background is not required, but you will need an understanding of linear algebra at the level of the intro courses. Moreover, you will need some familiarity with computer programming as this course is hands on using open source Python packages for working with publicly available quantum processors.


### Course calendar

One lecture per week. 8:00 – 12:00, Friday:
  - 26/02/21
  - 5-12-19-26/03/21
  - 2-9-16-30/04/21
  
Final exam. 8:00 – 12:00, Friday:
  - 7/05/21

### Textbook and readings

- [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf)
- [Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03719.pdf)

Complementary readings will be posted online with the syllabus for each lecture. These are critical.


### Grading

Final evaluation will consist of a written exam with questions on three research papers to study prior to the test.

### Assignements

No assignements, exercices and coding projects will be done in class.
